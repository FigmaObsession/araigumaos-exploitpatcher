__Updated tutorial how to remove exploit (9/8/2022)__

### About new AraigumaOS Exploit (if2)

There's a new exploit appears to be in HorizonOG Builds under 4000, something happened to main website sources, so now there's a huge problem.

### How to remove the exploit
1. Quickly check all files using 'chksys' in terminal.
If it says "Error" after "Re-checking the user folder...", then your PC is probably under control.
2. Check all paths for this exploit:
```username/AppData/Romaning/Fe
/username/AppData/Local/Fe
/username/AppData/Local/mo(randomized numbers 1-6)
```
If you found these folders, quickly delete them.
Then you should be fine.

Currently we can't patch this due to trash stuff, we can't access older builds.
Maybe soon we will find a way to patch this.
